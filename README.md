# 📊 Loan Prediction Model using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project focuses on building a **Loan Prediction System** using **Machine Learning** to automate the process of determining loan eligibility based on applicant details. The model analyzes historical loan application data and predicts whether a loan should be **approved or rejected**, helping financial institutions make faster and more accurate decisions.
